# Bootstrap-responsive-portfolio

In this project, i used Bootstrap CSS framework to create a mobile responsive porfolio with three sites. Each site has been styled using Bootstrap and a some CSS. The three pages include a Navbar that collapses depending on the screen size and includes links to the other pages, my name which will redirect the user to the about page and also a footer. 

1.About me:
-The about me page includes a profile picture and a paragraph about me that talks about my past experience, where i want to go and my hobbies.

2. Portfolio:
-The portfolio page displays six place holder images that are 200x200 that collapse into one colunm when the creen gets too smal.

3. Contact:
-The contact page is where users can go to submit their information such as name, email address and message.
