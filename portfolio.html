            HI, my name is Christian Gomez Martinez, i was born in Mexico City and raised in Huntersville N.C. I am a Sous Chef at The Peninsula Country Club with 7 years of experience cooking for great people and famous guest. Throughout the years, my skills have been refined through experience and talented mentors in my culinary career. I enjoy testing my abilities in the kitchen by participating in culinary competitions and crafting my own menus, inspired by my ethnic background and composed of Latin American cuisine with European and Eastern influences. My passion for cooking began at an early age when I would wake up early, and cook my family breakfast or help my parents in the kitchen. The greater feeling comes from the enjoyment that I get from bringing friends and family together over great food and endless memories. I am happy to be part of a large group of talented culinarians and bring this passion to new ventures and to give back to our surrounding community.
